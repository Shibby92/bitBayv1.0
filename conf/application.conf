FAQAnswers1 = "You may, if you can, decide to reward their patience by refunding the shipping cost (let them know that in the apology email)."
FAQAnswers2 = "People with 0 feedback are not necessarily scammers.  We all had 0 feedback once."
FAQAnswers3 = "Promo offers are by invitation only; no party crashing allowed.  Unless there is an einstein among us, no one can figure out the criteria used by bitBay to get these promos."
FAQAnswers4 = "To make buyers feel comfortable about buying, we don’t disclose the results of a report. Reports from sellers help us make bitBay a great experience for everyone. Since the launch of the enhanced Report a Buyer feature, we’ve had more reports submitted by sellers. In response, we’ve been able to take more actions to prevent abuse by buyers. If we take action on a buyer who is reported for policy violations, any transaction defects created by that buyer are automatically removed. We will let sellers know if they have had defects removed either on their Seller Dashboard or via a monthly communication from bitBay."
FAQAnswers5 = "No. We strive to make sure cases get resolved fairly to the satisfaction of both parties. If you feel a case has been resolved unfairly, you can appeal the decision by providing new information to the case, such as additional information from the shipping carrier to Customer Support within 45 days from the day the case is closed. bitBay reviews information and documentation from both buyers and sellers in detail before making a final decision. If a seller's appeal is granted, all defects for that transaction will be automatically removed."
FAQAnswers6 = "First, place yourself in the buyer’s shoes and ask yourself if the buyer is asking for something unreasonable. You’ll find that most buyers just want to resolve an issue. If you feel the buyer is in fact using low Feedback as a threat or the buyer’s demands are beyond what you promised, please report that buyer. See eBay Feedback Extortion policy to learn more."
FAQAnswers7 = "Depending on a buyer’s behavior, there are a number of actions the team can take—from issuing a warning, to setting buyer restrictions, to suspending the buyer from our site. If we take action on a buyer, all defects created by that buyer will be automatically removed."
FAQAnswers8 = "Work with the buyer to reach a mutually agreeable solution in regard to this transaction. How you decide to proceed is ultimately determined by you and your customer service policy, but all sellers are expected to demonstrate a high level of customer service."
